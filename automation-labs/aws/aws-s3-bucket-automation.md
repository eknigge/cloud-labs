## What will you learn in this lab?
After completion of this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure AWS CLI on your machine
- Create AWS resource using CloudFormation template

## Prerequisites
To complete this lab, you will need the following:

- Reliable internet connection
- AWS access key

## Lab Instructions

### Exercise #1: Install and Configure AWS CLI

In this exercise you will install and configure the AWS CLI.

1. Download and install the latest AWS CLI version for your operating system from [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

At this point, you have learned how to install and configure AWS CLI on your machine.

### Exercise #2: Create an AWS S3 Bucket Using CloudFormation Template

In this exercise you will create an AWS S3 bucket using CloudFormation template.

1. Download the [template.yaml](template.yaml) to a folder on your local machine.
2. Deploy the CloudFormation template using the following command:
   ```
   aws cloudformation deploy --template-file template.yaml --parameter-overrides Email=[your_email_address] Name=[your_first_and_last_name] Initials=[your_initials] --stack-name [your_initials]-stack
   ```
3. Sign into the AWS Management console at [https://aws.amazon.com/console/](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) using your AWS credentials.
4. Go to the S3 service and validate that your S3 bucket is created.

#### Exercise Summary
