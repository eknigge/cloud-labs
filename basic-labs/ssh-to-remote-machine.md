## Lab Scenario

The objective of this lab is to connect to a remote machine using SSH and learn basic shell commands. You will also learn how to edit a file using the built-in Vi editor. At the end of this lab, you will be able to connect to a remote machine using SSH, know your user’s home folder, navigate the directory tree, browse files and create and save text files with Vi.

## Prerequisites

If you are Windows 10, MacOS, or Linux user, SSH will be available from the Command Prompt or Terminal. For earlier versions of Windows, you will need to install a third party SSH client.

> **Note:** You will need to have your instructor provide access information to the remote machine. This includes `IP address`, `username`, and `password`.

## Lab Instructions

1. Open SSH client window.
2. Type the following command:
   ```
   ssh <username>@<ip-address-of-the-remote-machine>
   ```
3. Enter the password for the remote machine.
4. *Milestone step:* At this point, you have learned how to connect to a remote machine using SSH.
5. Type `pwd` after the prompt `~`.
6. You will see the current folder location, which is the home folder of your user on the machine.
7. *Milestone step:* At this point, you have learned what is the path to the home folder for your user on the remote machine.

32. Type `:q` in the Vi command line (this is the bottom line of the window).
33. You will exit Vi.
34. Type `ls -al test.*` after the prompt `~`.
35. *Milestone step:* At this point, you have learned how to exit Vi text editor and find the file you have just created in your home folder.
36. Type `cd ..` after the prompt `~`.
37. Type `ls -al` after the prompt `~`.
