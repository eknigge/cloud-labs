## Lab Scenario
In this lab, you will provision an AWS EC2 Instance (VM) that runs Ubuntu Linux server operating system. Once the instance is provisioned, you will install a NGINX Web server software on it. Once the Web server is installed, we will verify that it is running by accessing its home page with a browser. Last, we will modify the home page to show the text `Hello, computelabadmin!`.

Each exercise below builds upon the previous one. You should start each new exercise from the last step of the previous exercise unless it is explicitly written otherwise.

## What will you learn in this lab?
After completion of this lab, you will be able to:

- Provision an EC2 instance in AWS.
- Connect to the newly provisioned instance using an SSH client.
- Use the command line to manually install a Web server on the instance.
- Connect to the Web server using a browser.
- Modify the Web server’s home page.
- Stop the instance.

## Prerequisites
To complete this lab, you will need the following:

- Reliable internet connection.
- An AWS Account used to access AWS Management Console.
