## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will provision an Amazon S3 bucket and create a static website in it. You will upload static web pages and images to the bucket that is used for the static web site and will test that the content is served properly.

Each exercise below builds upon the previous one. You should start each new exercise from the last step of the previous exercise unless it is explicitly written otherwise.

## What will you learn in this lab?

After completion of this lab, you will be able to:

- Provision an Amazon S3 Bucket.
- Create a static website in the newly provisioned Amazon S3 Bucket.
- Upload content to the static website.
- Test the static web site.
- Delete the Amazon S3 Bucket.

## Prerequisites

To complete this lab, you will need the following:

- Reliable internet connection.
- A free AWS Account used to access the AWS Management Console.

### Exercise #3: Upload Content to the Static Website in Amazon S3

In this exercise, you will upload content to the static website.

1. Create a new file on your local machine with name `index.html` and the following content:
   ```
