## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will provision a Microsoft Azure Storage account and create a static website in it. You will upload static web pages and images to the storage blob that is used for the static web site and will test that the content is served properly.

Each exercise below builds upon the previous one. You should start each new exercise from the last step of the previous exercise unless it is explicitly written otherwise.

## What will you learn in this lab?

After completion of this lab, you will be able to:

- Provision an Azure Storage Account
- Create a static website in the newly provisioned Azure Storage Account
- Upload content to the static website
- Test the static web site
- Delete the Storage account

## Prerequisites

To complete this lab, you will need the following:

- Reliable internet connection
- A work, school or personal Microsoft Account used to access Microsoft Azure Management Portal
- A subscription for Microsoft Azure
